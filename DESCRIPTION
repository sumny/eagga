Description: The eagga package is the official implementation of the EAGGA algorithm introduced in the paper
  "Multi-Objective Optimization of Performance and Interpretability of Tabular Supervised Machine Learning Models".
  By treating hyperparameter optimization of a machine learning algorithm as a multi-objective optimization problem, EAGGA
  allows for generating diverse models that trade off high performance and ease of interpretability in a single
  optimization run.
  Efficient optimization is achieved via augmentation of the search space of the learning algorithm by incorporating
  feature selection, interaction and monotonicity constraints into the hyperparameter search space which are represented
  in the form of group structures of features.
  eagga is well integrated within the mlr3 ecosystem allowing for plug and play changes of performance measures and
  resampling methods.
  Moreover, the iml package can be used for post hoc interpretable machine learning analyses.
